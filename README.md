# Lizard Game

###Overview
The game took inspiration from the classic snake game. In short, you navigate the lizard and help it eat food. After the lizard eats food, it grows and sheds its skin. I picked this game becuase its a classic game, worthy to pay tribute as well as it proving to use multiple js elements that I've learned from the course. 

###Explanation 
The rules of the game are simple. Move the lizard towards the food (red object) of the screen and help it it grow. Your score increases the more objects you consume. You lose when the lizard collides with any white squares (shed skin) on the screen.

###User stories: 
-When I press any of the arrow keys, the lizard will move in that direction. 
-When the lizard meets with a red square (food) , it grows and sheds its skin (white square), leaving it behind. 
-When the lizard bumps into any of its shed skin, the game is over.

###MVP Checklist
-Does the lizard move around the grid depending on which arrow key is pressed? 
-Does the lizard leave behind shed skin after eating food?
-Does the game end when the lizard collides any of the white squares?

###Strecth Goals:
Make a simple, yet aesthetically pleasing design/color scheme. 
Try to add sound effects when the snake consumes an object. 
Add visuals to when objects appears on screen
